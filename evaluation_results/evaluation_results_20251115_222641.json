              "Paid ad campaigns across multiple platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Google, Yelp, Geofencing) will struggle to gain significant traction or deliver substantial foot traffic/awareness with such limited daily/weekly spend in a dense urban environment.",

              "**Refine Influencer Strategy:** For the current budget, focus exclusively on genuine micro-influencers or local creators who might be open to product exchange, smaller fees, or collaborative content creation, rather than aiming for 'prominent' influencers.",
              "**Detailed Event Planning for Low-Cost Execution:** Outline specific, very low-cost community event ideas (e.g., free coffee tastings, local artist showcases, book club meetups) that can be hosted within the cafe space, leveraging existing resources.",
              "**Emphasize Organic Growth & Community Management:** Given budget constraints, heavily invest time and effort into organic strategies: actively engaging in local Facebook/Nextdoor groups, encouraging reviews, fostering user-generated content organically, and building relationships with local businesses for cross-promotion.",
              "**Consider a Longer Campaign Duration:** Spreading the $2500 budget over a longer period (e.g., 3-6 months) might allow for more consistent, albeit lower-intensity, activity, especially for community-building and organic efforts, rather than a short, underfunded burst."

Consider a minimum of 2-3x the current budget for an 8-week campaign to allow for meaningful ad spend, sustained reach, and impactful activations.",
              "**Prioritize Channels and Phased Approach:** If the budget cannot be increased, prioritize 1-2 key channels from the 'Aggressive' or 'Experimental' plans that offer the highest ROI for the target persona (e.g., focused Instagram/Facebook video ads with lead generation, combined with targeted Google Search or Strava ads). Consider a phased approach, using the initial 8 weeks as a test phase to gather data and optimize for very specific, measurable objectives (e.g., lead generation for PT consultations) rather than broad membership increases.",
              "**Leverage Cost-Effective Content:** Maximize the use of user-generated content (UGC) and authentic testimonials, especially for the 'Peak Performance Challenge' and micro-influencer collaborations, to reduce creative production costs while maintaining the desired 'authentic' and 'results-driven' creative style.",
              "**Refine Event/Partnership Scope:** For local events or partnerships, focus on highly targeted, low-cost activations that maximize direct engagement and lead capture with Summit Seeker Sara, rather than broad sponsorships that may exceed the current budget's capacity."
